# User scripts #

Javascript scripts for TamperMonkey / Chromium / Chrome. Not tested in FireFox and Greasemonkey, but they should work with a bit of tweaking.

## image_download_helper.user.js ##
Adds custom keyboard shortcuts to : 
 * open the image under cursor in tab: ALT key
 * download image under cursor: SHIFT + w (or z depending on layout)
 * download image currently opened in a tab: SHIFT

If you feel that you can improve the script, feel free to do so. The code is awful right now, until I learn more about javascript and clean it up.

## tumblr_image_size.user.js ##
A fork of https://greasyfork.org/scripts/9014-tumblr-image-size
Displays the actual best quality version ("raw") of a displayed pictures (after it's opened in a tab) instead of the 1280p version.
