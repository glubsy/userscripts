# User scripts #

Javascript scripts for TamperMonkey / Chromium / Chrome. Not tested in FireFox and Greasemonkey, but they should work with a bit of tweaking.

## image_download_helper.user.js ##
Adds custom keyboard shortcuts to : 
 * open the image under cursor in tab: ALT key
 * download image under cursor: SHIFT + w (or z depending on layout)
 * automatically downloads the best available version of the file (tumblr only)

If you feel that you can improve the script, feel free to do so. The code is awful right now, until I learn more about javascript and clean it up.

## tumblr_image_size.user.js ##
A fork of https://greasyfork.org/scripts/9014-tumblr-image-size
Displays the actual best quality version ("raw") of a displayed pictures (after it's opened in a tab) instead of the 1280p version.


## tumblr_archive_background_change.user.js ##
Change the white background color to dark.
